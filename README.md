# AlteZachen

A second hand mobile store

Project: AlteZachen - Development of a Mobile Second-Hand Marketplace Connecting Customers and Sellers

AlteZachen is a mobile application that serves as a dynamic marketplace, connecting buyers and sellers of various second-hand items. The name "AlteZachen," derived from Yiddish meaning "old things," pays tribute to the rich tradition of peddlers and traders dealing in used electronics, furniture, and household items. The application provides a centralized platform where individuals, including big companys and private customers, can easily browse, purchase, and sell a wide range of pre-owned goods while accessing vital information about each item.

In the master branch you shall find the code for this app.
